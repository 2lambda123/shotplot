# ShotPlot

A tool used to obtain spacial coordinates based on an ice hockey rink.

## Background

This tool is a project based on an off-hand remark from [Alyssa Longmuir](https://twitter.com/alyssastweeting) on [Episode 24](https://soundcloud.com/user-55198424/top-shelf-episode-24-angry-little-boulders#t=42:45) of the Top Shelf podcast. She works with statistics for women's hockey and wanted a tool that would give her the ability to map shots to coordinates on the ice. This is that tool.
