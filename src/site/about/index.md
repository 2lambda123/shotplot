## What is shotplot?

This is a project based on an off-hand remark from [Alyssa Longmuir](https://twitter.com/alyssastweeting) on [Episode 24](https://soundcloud.com/user-55198424/top-shelf-episode-24-angry-little-boulders#t=42:45) of the Top Shelf podcast. She works with statistics for women's hockey and wanted a tool that would give her the ability to map shots to coordinates on the ice. This is that tool.

## About the creator

shotplot was created by [Andrew Pucci](https://www.andrewpucci.com), a hockey fan since parking himself in front of his parent's console television to watch the Pittsburgh Penguins win back to back Stanley Cups in 1991 and 1992. He was introduced to women's hockey in 2003 when [Clarkson University](https://clarksonathletics.com/index.aspx?path=whock) added their NCAA Division I team and has never looked back. In the past, he's been a season ticket holder for the NWHL's [Boston Pride](https://www.nwhl.zone/page/show/3422135-boston-pride), but secretly hopes the [NWHL](https://www.nwhl.zone/) expands to Pittsburgh soon.

## How 'bout that logo, eh?

Many thanks to my good friend [Christopher Michon](http://cmichon.com/) for creating the fantastic logo for shotplot! Did you notice how he cleverly built an X and Y into the crossed hockey sticks?
